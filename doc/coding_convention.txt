1) Controller, Form, Routing file should be postfix admin If you are developing admin module.

e.g. UserAdminCrontroller, UserAdminType, user_admin.yml

2) Controller, Form, Routing file should not required any pre and postfix If you are developing front side module.

e.g. UserController, UserType, user.yml

3) Always create service of form.

e.g. If you are creating form for admin side user create it should be like this way:

fa_user.form.type.user_admin:
        class: Fa\Bundle\UserBundle\Form\UserAdminType
        arguments: ['@doctrine', '@security.encoder_factory']
        tags:
            - { name: form.type, alias: fa_user_user_admin }

please note the service name and alias convention:

name: bundlename.form.type.formname (e.g. fa_user.form.type.user_admin)
alist:bundlename_formanme (e.g. fa_user_user_admin)

In form's getName method use then same name that you have used in alias

public function getName()
{
    return 'fa_user_user_admin';
}

4) In controller never create form object directly.

e.g. new UserAdminType() - wrong method
e.g. fa_user_user_admin - correct method

e.g. $form = $formManager->createForm('fa_user_user_admin', $entity, $options);

5) Create saperate file to define various services.

e.g. services_search.yml (to define services related to search)
e.g. services_form_type.yml (to define services related to form)

6) Always use form theme for rendering form elements.

7) routing file name should be _ saperated.

8) Don't forget to put translation text.

9) Caption / Message convention
   - In listing "No records found" for zero result
   - Button name for add record should be "Add New" for all listing instead of individual names like "Add New User", "Add New Rule".
   - Caption name (listing title, sorting field title, Form field title) should be with first letter captial of each word.
     e.g. "Print Edition", "Users", "PAA Field Rules", "Postage Options", "Print Edition Name", "Selete Status" 
   - Delete record message should be common for all listing which is "Do you want to delete this record?"
   - Add record success message should be common "Record has been added successfully."  
   - Update record success message should be common "Record has been updated successfully."
   - Delete record success message should be common "Record has been deleted successfully."
