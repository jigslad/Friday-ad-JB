Friday-Ad keeps your original phone number private but still allows potential buyers to contact you directly. We believe people value keeping this privacy.</p> <b>How does it work?</b> <p>Your phone number will be replaced by an 07044, 07092 or 07052 number when your advert is published. When a potential buyer calls this number the call is automatically redirected to your private number. Your private number always remains confidential.</p> <b>How much does the call cost the caller?</b> <p>At Friday-Ad we place many adverts free of charge, in order to continue to do so we make a small amount of revenue from the 070 service that we now offer. This has also been universally welcomed for the privacy that it now offers our Private advertisers. Calls to privacy numbers are charged at 37.5p per minute at peak times, falling to 25p per minute in the evenings and just 12.5p per minute at the weekends (BT landline customers). If you are not with BT, calls will be charged at your own operators rate. Calls from mobiles will vary depending on the rate charged by your operator.</p> <p>To help give our advertisers additional response, here at Friday-Ad, we randomly select some free online ads to be published in our Friday-Ad printed editions. When free ads appear in print, they will automatically have a privacy number assigned to them to protect your privacy.</p>', 2, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'privacy-number-block', NULL, 1, 1426654849, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),
